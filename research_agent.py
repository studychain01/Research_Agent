# ================================
# ðŸ“¦ Module Significance Overview
# ================================

# streamlit: Used to build the frontend/UI for the app (buttons, input, layout, etc.)
# os: Enables interaction with the operating system, especially to read environment variables like API keys.
# uuid: Generates unique identifiers (e.g., for session tracking or trace IDs).
# asyncio: Supports asynchronous execution, allowing multiple tasks (like agent calls) to run without blocking.
# datetime: Provides utilities to work with date and time (e.g., saving timestamps for collected facts).
# load_dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file into os.environ for secure configuration.
# BaseModel (from pydantic): Defines structured, validated data models (e.g., for ResearchPlan and ResearchReport).
# agents (custom module):
#   - Agent: Represents an LLM-based agent with instructions, tools, and output behavior.
#   - Runner: Handles execution of agents with input prompts and tracks output.
#   - WebSearchTool: A built-in tool for live web searching via the agent.
#   - function_tool: Decorator to turn a Python function into a callable agent tool.
#   - handoff: Transfers the task from one agent to another in a workflow.
#   - trace: Captures logs and traces of the agent's behavior for debugging or visualization.
